- [ ] seed data

- [ ] guest login

- [ ] a 'splash page' (homepage, landing page, thing)

- [ ] paginating forms#index, submissions#index

- [ ] better confirm magic?

- [ ] push to heroku

- [ ] promulgating removes all the inputs from the form for some reason?

- [ ] abstractify backbone error message magic to forms#new (it validates presence: true on form name)

It would be great to know if you are building this site to target a certain group of audience / users. If I am a recruiter, I want to know and understand the functionality of your site within seconds they check out your site. Here are my suggestions:

On your splash page, I'd suggest you to add a short phrase above the login box (near your Promulgation login) to describe what is this site about (e.g. The Form Builder for ...) 

After signing in, I'd suggest you to provide a short description (may be in bullet points) that covers cool any features and highlight users that you are trying to target

One of the best way to demonstrate the functionalities of your site is to use examples to talk about what it is used for (i.e. include more seeding data).

You can even want to include a mini demo video to illustrate the functions and advantages

some user stories (to help brainstorm seed data):

* Garshe Shnark the reknown self published author has been noticing a decline in sales in his bestselling serial "Adventures of Dark Darkdoom", for his latest episode, "Dark Darkdoom versus Shadowdark Dragon!" has been a record low in sales for the series. He's trying to figure out why his audience is losing interest in his series, so he sends out a questionnaire to his mailing list to ask his biggest fans what they thought about the episode, and where they think Dark Darkdoom should go next.
* Ato Ringleside is the owner the startup BabyElephantHugs that brings baby elephants to people's houses on command. He's been trying to figure out how he could improve his customer's experience with the elephants. He's decided to include a feedback form in their receipts, but is unsure how to go about it.

- [ ] form settings
  - [ ] send confirmation email to user (requires email field)
  - [ ] define splash page / text displayed after submission
  - [ ] captcha toggle
  - [ ] notification options
    - [ ] Email
    - [ ] Text
    - [ ] Google Docs Integration
    - [ ] CSV FTP integration

- [ ] being able to download a CSV of submissions would make sense

- [ ] form edit - the field should have help bubbles that explain the meaning of fields (especially min and max &c)

- [ ] need an animation on form index delete

- [ ] live validation updating (while you type)

- [ ] the input for writing labels should be a textarea that respects endlines
      ->  Should probably have it support commonmark

- [ ] forms are actually deleting, they should really just be marked as dead
      => or, maybe if they don't have any promulgated versions, they could be brung down proper destruction upon their heads

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- [ ] showing the users sessions on the user edit page
- [ ] allowing the user to edit their password on user edit
- [ ] forgot password

- [ ] form settings
  - [ ] no duplicate IPs

- [ ] setup figaro

- [ ] when you delete a property child, focus() on the next child
      -> wait, why?

- [ ] resorting field children
- [ ] make the New choice button into a draggable (constrained to .table)

- [ ] initialize dropdowns &c with three children
- [ ] fix checkbox and radio formatting on the form edit page
      => for example, two empty checkboxes move onto the same line
- [ ] .properties-open should show/hide when entering/leaving the tab

- [ ] make the form show page clearner (cut out backbone &c)
      => so that it can be embedded as an iframe fairly cleanly

- [ ] investigate whether embedding it as an iframe is the way to go

 - [ ] users should be able to specify min and max (word/character) lengths for text, textfields, &c

- [ ] handle going to like #forms/:id for a form that doesn't exist

- [ ] allow 'other' inputs inside radios / checkboxes

  - [ ] send CSV to FTP endpoint
- [ ] commenting on submissions

- [ ] advanced fields (address, likert, code editor, markup editor, video)

on publishing a new live version of a form
  you have to run through all the previous submissions and update their field_id
  to match the new live field_id
  and mark those which were for a field which is no longer live as state: 'dead'
