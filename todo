* the tabs in the edit view should have a border-radius of 3px, and padding of 10px 10px 5px 10px
  * this brings them in line with the buttons used throughout the interface.

---

* maybe replace the new form icon?

* I set the created_at dates to (id**2).hours.ago, but after a month they'll all
say '1 month ago' &c. So, new rake task?

* can't read paragraphs in submission modals, 
  add {width: 300px; whitespace: pre-wrap; } or the like
  see http://localhost:3000/#/forms/5/submissions for an example
* also the shadow on that modal needs to be {position: fixed}

---

* 10 surveys, with 3 submissions.

* restructure the tour

* snip column values that are too long to show on one line

---

* only show the navbar if the user is the owner (d'oh!)
* only show submissions & view form if the form has been promulgated

* pagination (forms index, submissions index)
* google drive integration

* Try an image search of words like 'forms' or 'feedback' or 'survey' and see if any pics could be incorporated as a background image.

* As for seed data, if it's a lot of work, a smaller number of surveys (around 10?) with great seed data would be better than a lot of surveys with mediocre seed data.  If making great surveys and submissions is taking a long time, it would be ok to pare down a bit.

* only show the navbar if the user is the owner (d'oh!)
* only show submissions & view form if the form has been promulgated

* add a few more submissions for each form.  
* On the pages for each form, across the top, add a "Delete" button 

* pagination (forms index, submissions index)
* google drive integration

---

* if the first item is a dropdown,
  and you ctrl+r then click on the properties tab, it won't have children.
  if you click on the dropdown on the right it will acquire children.
  * there's also the old problem where it doesn't animate the arrow into place

---

Seeding todos

* brainstorm ideas for forms to make.
* write some questionnaires (strawberry cupcakes, etc)
* generate some questionnaires somehow...

* add pagination to forms index
* add pagination to submissions index

should aim for like 30-ish forms I guess? with like three questions each?

probably just lorem ipsum for the submissions

---

rake db:data:dump

rake db:drop db:create db:migrate db:data:load

rake db:data:load

---

[after bugfixes]

* integrate with google drive?

---

it is difficult to see what it does or how powerful it is.

* Add an image to the background of the landing page.
* Make a background image once in the site.
* Add more pictures/fonts/color in general. For example, the Add A Field buttons could all have icons.  

* The tour currently guides the user to fill out a form. No one likes filling out forms.
  * Instead, make the tour guide someone through the site.
  * For example, say the site allows users to make forms and collect feedback.
  * Show one of the forms and the feedback so far. The last step should ask the user to make a form.

---

* sub fields are not preserving their order on 'production'
  * also it's not always saving???
  * aaand they randomly re-sort themselves when you change stuff sometimes.
* also I just had a problem where a textarea didn't have it's height properly set,
  * so it was covering the shorter text field below it
* reloading the form edit page doesn't load the fields...

I'm no longer getting any of these issues : /

That is frustrating.

- [ ] shepherd
- [ ] metric tons of seed data

> I think your form requires a title. Perhaps you should tell user that with a warning.

Add more seed data

Using forms:
When a form is submitted with errors, use window.top or window.scrollTo to pull user to errors
Submitting a form should redirect somewhere.

---

- [ ] seed data

- [ ] paginating forms#index, submissions#index

- [ ] better confirm magic?

- [ ] abstractify backbone error message magic to forms#new (it validates presence: true on form name)

---

some user stories (to help brainstorm seed data):

* Garshe Shnark the reknown self published author has been noticing a decline in sales in his bestselling serial "Adventures of Dark Darkdoom". His latest episode, "Dark Darkdoom versus Shadowdark Dragon!" has been a record low in sales for the series. He's trying to figure out why his audience is losing interest in his series, so he sends out a questionnaire to his mailing list to ask his biggest fans what they thought about the episode, and where they think Dark Darkdoom should go next.
* Ato Ringleside is the owner the startup BabyElephantHugs that brings baby elephants to people's houses on command. He's been trying to figure out how he could improve his customer's experience with the elephants. He's decided to include a feedback form in their receipts, but doesn't have the time to develop the form or analytics.

    - [ ] Email
    - [ ] Text
    - [ ] Google Docs Integration

- [ ] being able to download a CSV of submissions would make sense

- [ ] form edit - the field should have help bubbles that explain the meaning of fields (especially min and max &c)

- [ ] need an animation on form index delete

- [ ] live validation updating (while you type)

- [ ] the input for writing labels should be a textarea that respects endlines
      ->  Should probably have it support commonmark

- [ ] forms are actually deleting, they should really just be marked as dead
      => or, maybe if they don't have any promulgated versions, they could be brung down proper destruction upon their heads

      -> wait, why?

- [ ] resorting field children
- [ ] make the New choice button into a draggable (constrained to .table)

- [ ] initialize dropdowns &c with three children
- [ ] fix checkbox and radio formatting on the form edit page
      => for example, two empty checkboxes move onto the same line
- [ ] .properties-open should show/hide when entering/leaving the tab

- [ ] make the form show page clearner (cut out backbone &c)
      => so that it can be embedded as an iframe fairly cleanly

- [ ] investigate whether embedding it as an iframe is the way to go

 - [ ] users should be able to specify min and max (word/character) lengths for text, textfields, &c

on publishing a new live version of a form
  you have to run through all the previous submissions and update their field_id
  to match the new live field_id
  and mark those which were for a field which is no longer live as state: 'dead'
