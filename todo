* if the first item is a dropdown,
  and you ctrl+r then click on the properties tab, it won't have children.
  if you click on the dropdown on the right it will acquire children.
  * there's also the old problem where it doesn't animate the arrow into place

[after bugfixes]

* integrate with google drive?

---

it is difficult to see what it does or how powerful it is.

* Add an image to the background of the landing page.
* Make a background image once in the site.
* Add more pictures/fonts/color in general. For example, the Add A Field buttons could all have icons.  

* There needs to be more example surveys and results when the guest logs in.  Add more seed data.  

* The tour currently guides the user to fill out a form. No one likes filling out forms.
  * Instead, make the tour guide someone through the site.
  * For example, say the site allows users to make forms and collect feedback.
  * Show one of the forms and the feedback so far. The last step should ask the user to make a form.

---

* sub fields are not preserving their order on 'production'
  * also it's not always saving???
  * aaand they randomly re-sort themselves when you change stuff sometimes.
* also I just had a problem where a textarea didn't have it's height properly set,
  * so it was covering the shorter text field below it
* reloading the form edit page doesn't load the fields...

I'm no longer getting any of these issues : /

> I think your form requires a title. Perhaps you should tell user that with a warning.

Add more seed data

Using forms:
When a form is submitted with errors, use window.top or window.scrollTo to pull user to errors
Submitting a form should redirect somewhere.

---

- [ ] seed data

- [ ] paginating forms#index, submissions#index

- [ ] better confirm magic?

- [ ] abstractify backbone error message magic to forms#new (it validates presence: true on form name)

---

some user stories (to help brainstorm seed data):

* Garshe Shnark the reknown self published author has been noticing a decline in sales in his bestselling serial "Adventures of Dark Darkdoom". His latest episode, "Dark Darkdoom versus Shadowdark Dragon!" has been a record low in sales for the series. He's trying to figure out why his audience is losing interest in his series, so he sends out a questionnaire to his mailing list to ask his biggest fans what they thought about the episode, and where they think Dark Darkdoom should go next.
* Ato Ringleside is the owner the startup BabyElephantHugs that brings baby elephants to people's houses on command. He's been trying to figure out how he could improve his customer's experience with the elephants. He's decided to include a feedback form in their receipts, but doesn't have the time to develop the form or analytics.

  - [ ] captcha toggle
  - [ ] notification options
    - [ ] Email
    - [ ] Text
    - [ ] Google Docs Integration
    - [ ] CSV FTP integration

- [ ] being able to download a CSV of submissions would make sense

- [ ] form edit - the field should have help bubbles that explain the meaning of fields (especially min and max &c)

- [ ] need an animation on form index delete

- [ ] live validation updating (while you type)

- [ ] the input for writing labels should be a textarea that respects endlines
      ->  Should probably have it support commonmark

- [ ] forms are actually deleting, they should really just be marked as dead
      => or, maybe if they don't have any promulgated versions, they could be brung down proper destruction upon their heads

- [ ] resorting field children
- [ ] make the New choice button into a draggable (constrained to .table)

- [ ] initialize dropdowns &c with three children
- [ ] fix checkbox and radio formatting on the form edit page
      => for example, two empty checkboxes move onto the same line
- [ ] .properties-open should show/hide when entering/leaving the tab

- [ ] make the form show page clearner (cut out backbone &c)
      => so that it can be embedded as an iframe fairly cleanly

- [ ] investigate whether embedding it as an iframe is the way to go

 - [ ] users should be able to specify min and max (word/character) lengths for text, textfields, &c
